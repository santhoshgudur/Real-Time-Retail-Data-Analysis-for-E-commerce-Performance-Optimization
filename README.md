# Real-Time Retail Data Analysis for E-commerce Performance Optimization

I have worked on a real-time data processing project for RetailCorp Inc., an e-commerce company, to analyze and optimize their global sales performance. This project involved ingesting real-time sales data using Apache Kafka and processing it with Apache Spark Streaming to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs). The insights derived from this project were critical in understanding sales patterns and improving business strategies.

## Key Responsibilities:
- Ingested and processed real-time sales data from a centralized Kafka server.
- Developed data preprocessing scripts to calculate additional derived columns such as total cost and total items.
- Computed various time-based and country-based KPIs including total sales volume, orders per minute, rate of return, and average transaction size.
- Stored KPI data in JSON files for further analysis and visualization.
- Implemented a robust data pipeline architecture using tools such as HDFS, Spark Streaming, and Kafka.

## Skills Utilized:
- Apache Kafka: Managed data ingestion from a Kafka server, ensuring efficient and reliable data streaming.
- Apache Spark Streaming: Processed real-time data streams and implemented complex transformations and aggregations.
- Big Data Technologies: Leveraged Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for data storage and managed large datasets.
- Data Analysis: Calculated key performance indicators to provide actionable insights for business decision-making.
- Python: Developed UDFs (User Defined Functions) and utilized various Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- Data Visualization: Prepared data for visualization

## Outcome:
Successfully delivered a real-time data analysis solution that enabled RetailCorp Inc. to monitor and analyze their global sales performance in real-time. The project provided valuable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and market dynamics, helping the company to optimize their operations and improve customer satisfaction.
